Beneath eastern skies,<br>
Research assistant thrives,<br>
A mystical life.<br>

<h3><b>On hardwork, patience, and writing </b></h3>

<ul> <li> when I was young, I was working all day, from 9 to 11.
	<ul> <li> Mikhail Gromov
	</ul>
</ul>	


<ul> <li> something to do with probability distributions on groups. That got us started. We learned whatever tools we needed in order to solve the problem and eventually solved the problem and also learned the tools. It was a lot of fun because we were three of us .. constantly exchanging ideas.. started 7 o'clock in the morning.. We were all bachelors, living in the same dormitory.. So the work day consisted of 7 am till 9 pm. It was a terrific time to learn.
	<ul> <li> S.R. Srinivasa Varadhan
	</ul>
</ul>


<ul> <li> as a colleague put it, Grothendieck had done mathematics twelve hours a day, seven days a week, and twelve months a year for twenty years.
	<ul> <li> "Who Is Alexander Grothendieck", Winfried Scharlau
	</ul>
</ul>	


<ul> <li> I don't have any magical ability. ... When I was a kid, I had a romanticized notion of mathematics, that hard problems were solved in 'Eureka' moments of inspiration. But with me, it's always, 'Let's try this. That gets me part of the way, or that doesn't work. Now let's try this. Oh, there's a little shortcut here.' You work on it long enough and you happen to make progress towards a hard problem by a back door at some point. At the end, it's usually, 'Oh, I've solved the problem.'
	<ul> <li> Terry Tao
	</ul>
</ul>
	
<ul> <li> my true philosophy about how to do research, which is just this, 'make one percent progress per day for a hundred days'.. and then you'll solve your problem. It's a little like what the novelist's advice always is, 'write a little everyday'. This is how you make progress in math as well.
	<ul> <li> Ryan O'Donnell
	</ul>
</ul>

I remember a professor of Mathematics at MIT,  <br>
name of BERTRAM KOSTANT,  <br>
who would keep his door open whenever he was in his office, and he would always be at his desk writing.  <br>
Writing. Always writing.  <br>
Was he writing up his research? Maybe.  <br>
Writing up his ideas? Maybe.  <br>
I personally think he was reading, and writing what he was reading.  <br>
At least for me, writing what I read is one of the most enjoyable and profitable ways to learn hard material. <br>
