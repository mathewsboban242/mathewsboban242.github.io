<ul><li>"I think this theorem [Fermat's Last Theorem] had an importance in my own mathematical career in that when I was a teenager, at some point, I realized that Fermat's Last Theorem had actually been proven. I started to read about what went into this and so I learned about these fascinating objects of elliptic curves and modular forms.. but I didn't know what a matrix was! Somehow I worked my way backwards from this theorem trying to understand mathematics."

<h3><b>On Work</b></h3>

<ul> <li>"... when I was young, I was working all day, from 9 to 11"
	<ul> <li> Mikhail Gromov
	</ul>
</ul>	


<ul> <li>".. something to do with probability distributions on groups. That got us started. We learned whatever tools we needed in order to solve the problem and eventually solved the problem and also learned the tools. It was a lot of fun because we were three of us .. constantly exchanging ideas.. started 7 o'clock in the morning.. We were all bachelors, living in the same dormitory.. So the work day consisted of 7 am till 9 pm. It was a terrific time to learn." 
	<ul> <li> S.R. Srinivasa Varadhan
	</ul>
</ul>


<ul> <li>"as a colleague put it, Grothendieck had done mathematics twelve hours a day, seven days a week, and twelve months a year for twenty years" 
	<ul> <li> "Who Is Alexander Grothendieck", Winfried Scharlau
	</ul>
</ul>	

<ul> <li>"… Scott [Aaronson] hosted me while I was visiting MIT during the spring of 2016 and introduced me to the world of complexity theory. We had a lot of fun together thinking about quantum complexity. During that visit, I often thought very hard about problems until 7 am, and woke up sometime in the afternoon and repeated. I probably cannot (and should not) do that now, but that is an excellent memory."   
	<ul> <li> Lijie Chen
	</ul>
</ul>	

<ul> <li>Actually on the first day when I came to meet with Benny [Sudakov], I thought it was a chat.. when I started as an official PhD student at Princeton. And instead he just gave me a problem and said "let's read this paper.. and maybe come back and meet again in three hours..". Three hours later we started talking, and he said, "Great, now tonight, why don't you do this? And we meet again tomorrow"... I did not know this is what would happen on the first day..</br>
...so after I started to work with Benny, I discovered what I had gotten into.. So much so that one summer when I was working at a hedge fund.. This was when Benny was moving from Princeton to UCLA.. During that summer I was working at a Hedge Fund.. And on the very first weekend, I thought, "this job... it feels like a vacation! There's a weekend! There are evenings!" When you work with Benny as a student, you meet on Friday afternoon and say, "So.. Let's do this, this, this and meet on Sunday.. I'll pick you up, we can talk in the office.."
