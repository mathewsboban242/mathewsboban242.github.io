<h2><b>Mathews Boban</b></h2>
Hi! I am Mathews. I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. I like problems that promise to involve other areas of mathematics, especially probability and analysis. Some specific areas of interest include analysis of Boolean functions, stochastic calculus, convex geometry, sum-of-squares, high-dimensional estimation, and robust statistics.

<i> Everything, somehow, fit together; some sly and benevolent Providence was revealing itself by degrees and I felt myself trembling on the brink of a fabulous discovery, as though any morning it was all going to come together–my future, my past, the whole of my life–and I was going to sit up in bed like a thunderbolt and say</i> oh! oh! oh!

<h2><b>Ongoing work</b></h2>
	<ul>
		<li> High-dimensional robust polynomial regression
		<ul>
			<li> Arnab Bhattacharyya, Mathews Boban, and Daniel Kane
			<li> We show that we can learn low-degree polynomials under adversarial \ell_\infty noise and a constant fraction of outliers with \ell_1 regression. My other work "Learning low-degree polynomials over the reals under adversarial \ell_\infty noise" uses \ell_\infty regression algorithm and the analysis uses estimates of least singular values of certain random matrices with non-iid entries. Meanwhile the \ell_1 regression analysis in this work employs VC inequality and the fact that for "nice" (which we make precise) distributions, the integral of low-degree polynomials over a small set is small and dimension-independent.

			<li> Highlight: "mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll never get anywhere. Instead, you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning "forwards". (Caution: this backfilling is necessary. There can be a temptation to learn lots of fancy words and to use them in fancy sentences without being able to say precisely what you mean. You should feel free to do that, but you should always feel a pang of guilt when you do.)"

<!-- <ul> <li> "If you’ve never missed a flight, you’re spending too much time in airports."

<!-- <ul>
	<li> My favourite twentieth-century author in those days was E. M. Forster ... I admired especially the cult of personal relations that Forster espoused. His view that friendship, warmth and honesty between people mattered more than any cause or any system of belief was for me a practical as well as a romantic ideal. ‘I hate the idea of causes,’ he wrote, ‘and if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.’ That claim, from an essay called ‘What I Believe’ and published in his collection Two Cheers for Democracy, was taken by some to be all but treasonable. Given his connections to the group later known as the Cambridge Spies, it may be easy to see why such a credo still causes unease. He knew that, of course, for he went on to write, "Such a choice may scandalise the modern reader, and he may stretch out his patriotic hand to the telephone at once and ring up the police. It would not have shocked Dante, though. Dante places Brutus and Cassius in the lowest circle of Hell because they had chosen to betray their friend Julius Caesar rather than their country Rome."
