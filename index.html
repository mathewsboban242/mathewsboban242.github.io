<h2><b>Mathews Boban</b></h2>
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, where I am privileged to be advised by <a href = "https://sites.math.washington.edu/~rothvoss/"> Thomas Rothvoss</a>. I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. <br> I was a research assistant at the National University of Singapore with <a href = "https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~arnab/">Arnab Bhattacharyya</a>, <a href = "https://mchchoi.github.io/">Michael Choi</a>, and <a href = "https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~rahul/">Rahul Jain</a> from February 2023 to August 2024. Before that, I was a research intern at the Technion with <a href = "https://yuvalfilmus.cs.technion.ac.il/">Yuval Filmus</a>. Even before that, I was an undergraduate in computer science at IIT Bombay and graduated in 2021.

			<li> Highlight: "mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll never get anywhere. Instead, you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning "forwards". (Caution: this backfilling is necessary. There can be a temptation to learn lots of fancy words and to use them in fancy sentences without being able to say precisely what you mean. You should feel free to do that, but you should always feel a pang of guilt when you do.)"
