<p>There are two ways to become more resilient: one by talking to yourself, the other by retraining your brain.</p>
<p>If you have sufferred a major failure: </p>
<p>Talk to yourself. Give yourself a cognitive intervention and counter defeatist thinking with an optimistic attitude. Challenge your downbeat thinking and replace it with a positive outlook.</p>
<p>What about bouncing back from the more frequent annoying screwups, minor setbacks, and irritating upsets? </p>
<p>Practice mindfulness mediation.</p>
